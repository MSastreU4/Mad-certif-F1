        <h3>Sebastian Vettel</h3>
        <p>Sebastian is not only known for being a four-times world champion but because his actions speak louder than words. In the last few months he has promoted actions to protect the bees, recycle at the circuits (by picking up litter at the end of the race weekend), promoting LGTBI+ rights in countries with restrictive laws among many other things.</p>
        <p>German, mentor to <a href="MSC.htm">Mick Schumacher.</a></p>
