        <h1>Racing and Strategy</h1>
        <p>A <MadCap:variable name="General.Formula 1" /> Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It begins with two free practice sessions on Friday (except in Monaco, where Friday practices are moved to Thursday), and one free practice on Saturday. Additional drivers (<span>commonly </span>known as reserve drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat. A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.</p>
        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>There are a set of rules specific for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>tyres</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>qualifying</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>race</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The race is at all times controlled by the Race director and a set of marshals, all of them FIA delegates. The race director is in charge of controlling the safety of the race and the compliance of all the rules that apply to cars and the race itself.</p>
        <p>Any breach in the rules is then signalled with a flag system. </p>
