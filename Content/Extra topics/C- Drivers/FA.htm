        <h3>Fernando Alonso</h3>
        <p>Fernando Alonso Diaz, two times World Champion with Renault (now Alpine). He two a couple of years off the F1 but compete in Le Mans, Indianápolis, Dakar... He works hard in everything he does, surely he is also a perfectionist washing the dishes too. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, he has no neck.</p>
